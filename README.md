# Codecademy_Learn_Java_Projects with Topics :open_book:

### :one: Planting a Tree<br />
Introduce yourself to users and plant a tree for them!

### :two: Math Magic<br />
In this project, you will become a mathemagician and write a small program that performs a mathematical magic trick! It will involve performing arithmetic operations on an integer that you choose.

### :three: A Basic Calculator<br />
In this project, you will use classes, methods, and objects to create a simple arithmetic calculator. The calculator will be able to:

* Add two integers
* Subtract two integers
* Multiply two integers
* Divide two integers
* Apply the modulo operator on two integers

### :four: Build A Droid<br />
We’ve set up a robot workshop to build some droids.

### :five: A Simple Car Loan Payment Calculator<br />
In this project, you will write a program that will calculate the monthly car payment a user should expect to make after taking out a car loan. The program will include the following:

* Car loan amount
* Interest rate of the loan
* Length of the loan (in years)
* Down payment

### :six: Continents and Cities<br />
Write a Continents.java program that will print out a continent and the largest city in that continent, based on the value of an integer.

### :seven: Desert Island Playlist<br />
Build Playlist.java with the best possible playlist of music using a Java ArrayList. Choose wisely.

### :eight: Fizz Buzz<br />
Write a FizzBuzz.java program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100… with a catch:

* For multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number.
* For the multiples of 5, print Buzz.
* For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.

### :nine: The Prime Directive<br />
Finding prime numbers is a common technical challenge in programming interviews.

### :keycap_ten: DNA Sequencing<br />
Write a DNA.java program that determines whether there is a protein in a strand of DNA.

A protein has the following qualities:

* It begins with a “start codon”: ATG.
* It ends with a “stop codon”: TGA.
* In between, each additional codon is a sequence of three nucleotides.

### :one::one: Language Families<br />
Languages, just like people, often have families. You can even map language lineage a bit like a family tree.
